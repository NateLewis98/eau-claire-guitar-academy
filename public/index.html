            <h2>Meet Shane</h2>
                
            <p>Shane picked up his first guitar at age 15 when he received one for his birthday along with a Led Zeppelin song book. What started as learning Zeppelin classics quickly turned into a deep passion. He was drawn to their dynamic range and mythic storytelling, which inspired him to explore countless styles and become as musically diverse as possible.</p>

            <p>Today, with 24 years of playing and over 70 original songs on Spotify, Shane teaches the way he wishes he&rsquo;d been taught &mdash; fun, engaging, and 100% personalized. He treats his students like friends (because they quickly become friends), celebrates every small win, and especially loves helping people write their own original songs. To Shane, learning other people&rsquo;s music is just the bridge to creating your own sound.</p>

            <p>One of his favorite success stories is a 50-year-old with zero musical background who, after two years, became advanced enough to play live gigs. If you think you&rsquo;re &ldquo;too old&rdquo; or &ldquo;not musical enough,&rdquo; Shane wants you to know &mdash; that guy thought the same thing. Everyone has music inside them.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>I took 2 years of Guitar lessons with Shane and I learned enough for my family members and friends to consider me an expert! Shane is a phenomenal teacher that will assist you at your own pace and without judgement. Whether it's acoustic or electric, country music or rock, Shane will enthusiastically help you learn.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Shane is a fantastic guitar instructor. My son has gone to Shane for lessons for two years now. He connects with the students and makes them feel comfortable and find their love for music! Guitar is the one thing we do not have to ask him to practice or work on. He picks up his guitars daily and without prompting. We owe a big part of this to Shane. Highly recommended!!</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>I've been taking guitar lessons from Shane for about a year now. The reason why I've stuck around 
                    this long is because I've learned so much and have so much fun playing with Shane. We've turned many
                     of our jams into original songs that I now have in my repertoire. Writing music with Shane is 
                     probably my favorite part of lessons. He has a knack for finding the right chord progression to
                      complement something I've been working on. Or showing me a scale I can use to craft a solo over something I've
                       already come up with.
                       Shane's knowledge of music is deep. If you've got the guitar
                        itch, you can't go wrong with the Eau Claire Guitar Academy.</p>

                <p>Awesome experience! Shane was so chill and patient teaching me&hellip;I was a very beginner with not a lot of time to practice, but he always made me feel comfortable and I really enjoyed his teaching style. Highly recommend to anyone wanting to start out learning as a beginner, or to keep growing their current guitar skill level!</p>
