              we've turned complete beginners into confident players and experienced musicians into absolute

              Whatever your goal is, we build every lesson around you &mdash;not some cookie-cutter curriculum.</p>
        <p class="bold">Why students stick with us:</p>
        <ul>

                <p>I took 2 years of Guitar lessons with Shane and I learned enough for my family members and friends to consider me an expert! Shane is a phenomenal teacher that will assist you at your own pace and without judgement. Whether it's acoustic or electric, country music or rock, Shane will enthusiastically help you learn.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Shane is a fantastic guitar instructor. My son has gone to Shane for lessons for two years now. He connects with the students and makes them feel comfortable and find their love for music! Guitar is the one thing we do not have to ask him to practice or work on. He picks up his guitars daily and without prompting. We owe a big part of this to Shane. Highly recommended!!</p>

                <p>I've been taking guitar lessons from Shane for about a year now. The reason why I've stuck around 
                    this long is because I've learned so much and have so much fun playing with Shane. We've turned many
                     of our jams into original songs that I now have in my repertoire. Writing music with Shane is 
                     probably my favorite part of lessons. He has a knack for finding the right chord progression to
                      complement something I've been working on. Or showing me a scale I can use to craft a solo over something I've
                       already come up with.
                       Shane's knowledge of music is deep. If you've got the guitar
                        itch, you can't go wrong with the Eau Claire Guitar Academy.</p>

                <p>Awesome experience! Shane was so chill and patient teaching me&hellip;I was a very beginner with not a lot of time to practice, but he always made me feel comfortable and I really enjoyed his teaching style. Highly recommend to anyone wanting to start out learning as a beginner, or to keep growing their current guitar skill level!</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Shane is VERY knowledgeable with the guitar and teaching someone who has never played. He takes his time with you and making sure you understand. The price is reasonable.</p>

                <p>My grandson age 13 met Shane and has been picking up his guitar every day since! Shane is not only knowledgeable but also a super fun instructor! Thank you Shane and Sarah!</p>

                <p>Shane has all the knowledge and patience you could ever ask for when trying to learn the guitar. I'd recommend a jam session with him to absolutely anyone.</p>
