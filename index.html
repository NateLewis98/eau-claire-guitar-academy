        <p>Whether you just picked up your first guitar or you've been playing for years and hit a wall,
             we'll get you where you want to go. With over six years of teaching right here in Eau Claire,
              we've turned complete beginners into confident players and experienced musicians into absolute
               monsters.</p>
        <p>All ages. All levels. All genres. One lesson at a time.</p>
        <p class="bold">Your goals. Your pace. Your music.</p>
        <p>Want to strum your favorite songs around the campfire? Write originals that give you chills?
             Shred solos that drop jaws? Maybe you just want to finally finish a song without stopping.
              Whatever your goal is, we build every lesson around you — not some cookie-cutter curriculum.</p>
        <p class="bold">Why students stick with us:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lessons are fun. Like, actually fun. Not "play this scale forty times" fun.</li>
            <li>You'll see real progress fast because every session is 100% personalized.</li>
            <li>We teach what you want to play — country, rock, blues, jazz, metal, folk, pop, fingerstyle,
                 you name it.</li>
            <li>Kids, teens, adults, retirees — doesn't matter. If you've got hands and a heartbeat, we can teach you.</li> 
        </ul>

        <p class="bold">Life's too short to wish you could play.</p>
        <p class="italics">Spots fill up quick. Don't sit on this one.</p>
